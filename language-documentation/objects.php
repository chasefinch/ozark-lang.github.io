											<p><strong>Object</strong> is a generic term for describing an instance of a class. An object may be referenced by one or more pointers, which associate a name (such as <code>trainConductor</code> or <code>whiteRook</code>) with an object stored in memory.</p>

											<a name='EverythingIsAnObject'><h2>Everything is an object</h2></a>

											<p>Everything in Ozark is an object, even "primitive" types such as Integers and Booleans. Declaring an object literal (such as <code>5.3</code> or <code>true</code>) automatically creates the space in which that new object will reside, and so you are able to pass messages to even the object literals (e.g. <code>5 + 3 -&gt; sum</code>)</p>

											<p>Objects are allocated manually with the <code>create</code> keyword when declaring a pointer, and then have a method called immediately using the semicolon (<code>;</code>) syntax.</p>

											<a name="Pointers"><h2>Objects are stored in pointers</h2></a>

											<p>When a <strong>pointer</strong> is set to an object, it maintains a reference to that object. If a pointer is set to another pointer, they are both then pointing to the same object. If that object's properties change, the difference will be reflected no matter from which pointer it is referenced.</p>

											<a name="Optionals"><h2>Optionals</h2></a>

											<p>There is no concept of "nil" - Instead, <span itemprop='name'>Ozark</span> uses <strong>optionals</strong> to denote pointers that are allowed to nave no value. Pointers marked as optional have limited capabilities, but can be unpacked for conditional usage with the <code>with</code> keyword.</p>

											<p>You can specify an object as optional by including a question mark (<code>?</code>) after the type, and when you unpack it, use an exclamation point (<code>!</code>).</p>

											<a name="Generics"><h2>Generics</h2></a>

											<p>Classes that manage objects of a generic type can be built with <strong>generics</strong>. These special types are included in the class definition.</p>

											<p>Types are separated from the class name and from each other by a pipe (<code>|</code>)</p>

											<a name='BuiltInTypes'><h2>Built-In Types</h2></a>

											<p>There are 5 primary <strong>built-in types</strong> that come from the Ozark standard library: <code>Integer</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Boolean</code>, <code>Character</code>, and the user-defined <em>enumeration</em>. There is also the basic class <code>Object</code>. All of the basic types inherit from <code>Testable</code> (allowing them to be used in <code>if</code>/<code>unless</code> statements) and <code>Comparable</code> which defines basic functions to test for equality.</p>

											<p>These items are all required in <code>Object</code>, so any class that inherits from Object need not require them again.</p>

											<p>Rather than using the basic types heavily, create a class based on the real-world use case you are modeling. For example, if a Person may or may not have an ID badge with a <code>String</code> as an ID, don't store the ID as a <code>String</code> variable on the <code>Person</code> class. Instead, create an <code>IDBadge</code> class that is an optional property of the <code>Person</code> class. That way, an <code>IDBadge</code> must have a <code>String</code>, but a Person may have an optional ID Badge, and could theoretically swap it for a new one.</p>

											<a name='Integer'><h4>Integer</h4></a>

											<p>An <code>Integer</code> is the most basic of types. It's a number without a fractional component, like <code>0</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>-3</code>, or <code>10000</code>. Integers in Ozark are entered by default as decimals, but can be specified in binary with the prefix <code>0b</code> or in hexadecimal with the prefix <code>0x</code>. <code>0b1101</code> and <code>0x6A43</code> are examples of valid Integers in binary and hexadecimal, respectively.</p>

											<a name='Number'><h4>Number</h4></a>

											<p>A <code>Number</code> is the Ozark representation of a floating-point number, acting according to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point'>IEEE 754 standard</a>. A floating-point number is a number with a fractional component, such as <code>4.14</code>, <code>0.333</code>, or <code>-200.03</code>. By default, these appear in decimal, but are stored in binary, and are subject to common binary floating-point math characteristics. Like Integers, you can specify Number values in binary or hexadecimal using the <code>0b</code> and <code>0x</code> prefixes. <code>0b101101.1101</code> and <code>0x12F2.FF43</code> are examples of valid Numbers in binary and hexadecimal, respectively.</p>

											<p>A floating-point number has both a stored base, and a precision. The default base for a Number is 2, but you can also specify that a Number is in base 10 with the tick (<code>`</code>) symbol, like <code>create var1:Number`10</code> or <code>0.333`10</code>. This has much slower performance, and is only recommended for scenarios when modeling real-life decimal systems where decimal precision is important, like financial models.</p>

											<p>You can also specify a different precision for a Number using the degrees (<code>Â°</code>) symbol. The default precision is 32, but you can specify 64 and 128. <code>create var1:Â°128</code>, <code>1`10Â°64 / 3`10</code>.</p>

											<a name='Boolean'><h4>Boolean</h4></a>

											<p>A <code>Boolean</code> can only ever be true or false. Ozark provides two Boolean literals that represent the two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</p>

											<a name='Character'><h4>Character</h4></a>

											<p>A <code>Character</code> is a single character from the Unicode character set. A Character literal is surrounded by single quotes, such as <code>'x'</code>, <code>'3'</code>, <code>'^'</code>, or <code>'ðŸ™‰'</code>. You can also specify a unicode character with the <code>0u</code> prefix, followed by the unicode code point, like <code>0u0063</code>, which represents the latin lowercase letter "c".</p>

											<p>Ozark also has a <code>String</code> type, which is treated exactly as an <a href='collections#Arrays'>array</a> of Characters. To specify a string literal, surround the group of Characters with double quotes to denote a string, such as <code>"hello"</code>, <code>"1234"</code>, or <code>"wonderbread!!"</code>.</p>

											<p>The backslash <code>\</code> character is used as an escape character within strings. You can enter a backslash escaped by simply repeating it <code>\\</code>. Other control characters in a string must appear in source code in their escaped form, such as <code>\n</code> (newline) or <code>\t</code> (tab).</p>

											<a name='Enumeration'><h4>Enumeration</h4></a>

											<p>An <strong>enumeration</strong> is a value for which the possibilities are defined in advance. Enumerations are declared by the user, and can be nested within a class or can appear as a root-level file with the extension <code>.enumeration.ozark</code>. Enumerations follow the same naming convention as classes, and must have names unique from other classes and enumerations declared at the same level.</p>

											<p>Possible values for enumerations are declared with the <code>state</code> keyword, must start with a lowercase letter, and are referenced with dot notation.</p>
